# Description
The aim of this task is to:

Build a system that predicts user preferences based on existing user-item interactions.

Learn to implement either collaborative filtering (user-based or item-based) or matrix factorization (such as Singular Value Decomposition or SVD).

Evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to make accurate recommendations using suitable metrics.

Your model should take historical data of users and items (such as ratings, likes, or views) and learn patterns to recommend new items a user might like.

Instructions
Dataset selection: Choose a dataset that contains user-item interaction data. Common examples include the MovieLens dataset (user ratings of movies), Goodbooks-10k (book ratings), or any other dataset with sufficient users, items, and interactions. You can find these datasets on websites like Kaggle or GroupLens.

Approach: You can choose between:

Collaborative Filtering: This method works by finding similarities between users or items. In user-based collaborative filtering, you recommend items to a user based on the preferences of similar users. In item-based collaborative filtering, you recommend items that are similar to those the user has already liked or rated highly.

Matrix Factorization: This method involves decomposing the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices that represent users and items in latent space. A common technique is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This approach is useful for uncovering hidden factors that influence user preferences.

Implementation: Use Python libraries such as Surprise, Scikit-learn, Pandas, or frameworks that provide matrix factorization capabilities. Ensure your code is modular and well-commented. You can split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate performance.

Evaluation: After training your recommendation model, evaluate its accuracy in predicting user preferences. Metrics you can use include:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on predicted ratings.

Precision@k or Recall@k if you convert your task into a top-k recommendation problem.

Optionally, visualize performance with plots (e.g., error distributions, recommendation coverage).

Deliverable
Your deliverable for this task will be:

A Jupyter Notebook or an app interface that:

Loads and preprocesses the dataset.

Implements the chosen recommendation technique.

Displays sample recommendations for selected users.

Shows evaluation results and insights.

The notebook or app should include clear comments, explanations, and any visualizations you create to support your findings.

All code, models, and outputs should be stored in a well-organized GitHub repository as part of your internship submission.

Learning Outcomes
By completing Task 4, you will:

Gain hands-on experience with recommendation algorithms.

Understand the strengths and limitations of collaborative filtering and matrix factorization techniques.

Learn how to evaluate recommendation systems using industry-standard metrics.

Build confidence in using libraries and tools for real-world machine learning applications.
